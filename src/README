Executable can be built using make

Running refresh.sh will make and run the app on localhost:8080

***Be careful when using the delete button as it will actually delete the file from your system***

Media accessed by the app is stored in 'Media' folder

Media_Backup contains copies of the files for when the app deletes them from the 'Media' folder when testing the delete button
